## 🚀 About Me

In 1993, as a 19-year-old military police officer, I saw a green screen PC in a government office and decided: "I'm going to learn this." With no internet and no teachers, I ordered books and taught myself. I bought my first computer—an i486—and installed DOS, Windows, and later Linux from scratch.

Three decades later, that same curiosity drives my current focus: **building low-latency trading systems** that combine hardware acceleration with software optimization.

**What makes my background unique**: I'm not just an engineer learning about trading, or a trader learning to code. I've spent **5 years actively trading S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures** while maintaining 32 years of systems engineering experience. I understand market microstructure, order flow, and latency requirements from both sides—the technical implementation AND the trading desk perspective.

That foundation led to:

- 📚 Publishing 10 technical books
- 👨‍🏫 Training Java instructors at Sun Microsystems  
- 🏗️ Building production systems processing 26M+ data points with 99.8% uptime
- 🏢 Founded API-Led Pty Ltd in 2013
- 📈 5 years active futures trading (S&P 500, Nasdaq)

## 🎯 Career Objective

Seeking **C++/Java trading systems developer roles** at elite trading firms (Citadel Securities, Jane Street, IMC Trading, Optiver, Tower Research) where I can leverage my unique combination of:

- 32 years systems engineering experience
- 5 years active futures trading background
- FPGA hardware acceleration skills
- Low-latency C++ expertise
- Enterprise-scale system reliability experience

**Why my background matters**: Most trading engineers learn markets from textbooks. I learned them with real capital at risk. Most traders can't build production systems. I've built systems processing 26M+ data points with 99.8% uptime. This combination of trader insight and engineering depth creates unique value for trading technology teams.

**"In 1993, I saw a computer and decided to learn. In 2020, I saw the markets and decided to understand them. Now I build the systems that power both."**
